// TODO Structure of companies - shareholders, employees
// TODO Communication - agreements, employment contracts, promises (trust)

// agreement - actions/promises 
//      -> how many are employees/shareholders are alive by the end of the year; reset after 365 steps

// negotiations - demands/bids

// tradeoff between power and resources

// trust is updated with an RL schema based on how much they have kept their
// promises before. Agreements can be public or not, binding and non-binding

// We should start with only non-binding agreements, and maybe implement 
// binding agreements later

// MAYBE: also implement subcontracting. Later stage though
