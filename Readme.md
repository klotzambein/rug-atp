# Agent Technology Practical - Final Project
By Andrei Voinea, Ivaylo Zhelev and Robin Kock

## Compiling
This project needs Rust to compile. It is tested on linux, but should
work on windows. Since we depend on Imgui a c++ compiler might be
required, If anything is missing it will most likely give an error
during the compilation.

To compile and run: `cargo run`.
